### Reverse Complement DNA Sequence Project

## Overview

This Python project is designed to generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence. Given a DNA strand, the program computes the complementary strand by replacing each nucleotide with its pair (A <-> T, C <-> G) and then reversing the sequence. This is a crucial step in various bioinformatics workflows, such as sequence analysis, alignment, and PCR primer design.

## Features

- Converts a DNA sequence into its reverse complement.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase nucleotide inputs.
- Validates DNA sequences and reports errors for invalid characters.
- Supports fast and efficient processing of long DNA sequences.
