### Reverse Complement DNA Sequence Project

## Overview

This Python project is designed to generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence. Given a DNA strand, the program computes the complementary strand by replacing each nucleotide with its pair (A <-> T, C <-> G) and then reversing the sequence. This is a crucial step in various bioinformatics workflows, such as sequence analysis, alignment, and PCR primer design.

## Features

- Converts a DNA sequence into its reverse complement.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase nucleotide inputs.
- Validates DNA sequences and reports errors for invalid characters.
- Supports fast and efficient processing of long DNA sequences.

```Python
file = open("C:\\Users\\Yasodha\\Downloads\\dataset_30273_2 (1).txt", 'r')
dna_string = file.readline().strip()
def reverse_complement(dna_string):
    complement = {'A':'T','T':'A','C':'G','G':'C'}
    reversed_string = ''.join(complement[base] for base in reversed(dna_string))
    return reversed_string
string = reverse_complement(dna_string)
print(string)
```
